# Intro

I am a blockchain engineer specializing in Solana and Ethereum smart contract development. With over four years of experience in software development and two years in Web3, I have built secure and scalable blockchain solutions, including DeFi staking contracts, decentralized identity systems, and optimized order-book DEXs. My expertise spans Solidity, Rust, and decentralized application (dApp) development.

In addition to my technical work, I enjoy exploring new blockchain innovations, optimizing smart contract security, and contributing to open-source projects. If you're working on an exciting Web3 project and think I can help, feel free to reach out.

# Some History

- At 17, I built my first basic website using HTML and JavaScript, sparking my interest in programming.

- At 22, I started experimenting with cryptographic algorithms and blockchain fundamentals.

- At 24, I developed my first smart contract, an Ethereum-based token with custom minting logic.

  I participated in a blockchain hackathon, developing a DeFi staking contract that earned recognition for its efficiency.

- At 25, I started freelancing as a Web3 developer, contributing to DeFi projects, DAOs, and NFT marketplaces.

  I joined a Web3 startup, leading the development of Solana-based decentralized applications.
